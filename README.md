# Thoughts

Hello again!! Welcome to my first mobile application, a small social media where people can share their thoughts with the world.

---

Thank you for joining me in my coding journey!!

### Description

A react-native application where I put in practice my mobile development skills, Thoughts is a social media where people can post their thoughts and share their feelings.

### Setup

1. Install expo in your mobile device.
2. Run `npm install` in the root, client and server directories so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
3. Pass the correct information to the .env, config and dbConfing files to connect the program with a database.
4. Type the correct URL given from expo for the connection with the server to work properly in the _api.js_ file located in _/client/src/constans/api.js_.
5. In the client folder run `npx expo` to start the client and in the server folder run `npm run watch` for the app to work properly, then scan the project QR to start using the application with your mobile device.
